I'm Rakesh, a software engineer in this ever-evolving tech world. Right now, I'm leading the awesome Foundations team at Lyft, where we're tackling everything from real-time feature generation and machine learning platforms to experimentation, forecasting, and growth. It's a mouthful, but basically, we're building the core tech that makes a lot of the magic happen behind the scenes.</p> <p>My main passions in tech are AI/ML, crafting robust and scalable services, and diving deep into real-time stream processing. I'm genuinely fascinated by how these technologies are shaping our future. I've been fortunate enough to share some of my experiences and insights at various international conferences \u2013 I absolutely love connecting with people and geeking out about all things tech.</p> <p>You might find a few tech blogs floating around here too, although I'll admit, consistency isn't my strong suit! It's something I'm working on, so bear with me. But when I do get around to writing, it's usually about something I'm genuinely excited to share.</p> <p>So, feel free to poke around, and if you're into any of the same stuff, or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always up for a good conversation.</p> <p>Thank you for stopping by!</p>"},{"location":"ai-ml-resources.html","title":"AI/ML Resources","text":"<p>This page is a collection of AI/ML resources that I update regularly.
