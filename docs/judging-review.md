# Judging / Reviewing

A core principle guiding my professional activities is the importance of rigorous evaluation and constructive feedback. This principle manifests in my engagement with both emerging talent and established research. I see it as a way of giving back to the community that has supported my own growth.

As a judge for events like NextNiche and the Lyft Hackathon, I focus on encouraging innovation and problem-solving, challenging participants to develop impactful solutions. In the academic and publishing domains, I contribute my expertise by reviewing books, conference papers, and scholarly articles. This involves a detailed analysis of the work's methodology, findings, and overall contribution to its respective field. My goal is to provide authors and researchers with actionable insights that enhance the quality and impact of their work.

I welcome opportunities to contribute as a judge or reviewer. Please contact me through my [contacts page](contact.md) if you require my assistance.
