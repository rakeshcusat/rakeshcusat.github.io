# Public Speaking

I love to speak at conferences to share my knowledge with like minded people. I have listed down some of the past talks and upcoming talks for reference.

## Invite me to speak
I'm truly grateful for such opportunities to potentially share my experience and insights, especially on topics like MLOps, scalable architecture, LLMs, and Streaming/realtime processing which are areas I'm deeply passionate about.

I generally try my best to accommodate speaking engagements like this into my schedule, as I believe knowledge sharing is crucial for the growth of our field. I'm very interested in learning more about your event and how I might contribute.

To help me better understand the scope and determine my availability, please share some more details about your event when you have a moment. Information like the date, location, format (e.g., panel, presentation, workshop), expected audience, and specific topics you'd be interested in having me cover would be incredibly helpful.

You can find my contact details [here](contact.md). I look forward to hearing from you soon and hopefully collaborating!
